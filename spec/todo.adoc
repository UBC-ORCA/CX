== TODO

Todo:

* Chapter on CX Runtime (runtime) API
* How CX and CXU versioning works; how CXU-LI versioning works
* A place for miscellaneous design notes

=== Open design problems (post 1.0)

* Developing, running accelerated libraries on systems where there is no composable extension / CXU implementation.
* Developer tooling recommendations for disassembly, debugging, profiling, perf monitoring.

=== Cost model

[NOTE]
====
Here write up a brief estimate of the FPGA area overhead of various -Zicx and CXU-LI mechanisms and behaviors.
